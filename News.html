              <p>Yet again another victory for...we were playing 12.1.2020, the first tournament of the year was played in Rauma. There were 8 teams from Finland. The tournament lasted two days and we got a good training session and met more potential partners, so the tournament was also good for marketing. We rarely take part in tournaments in Finland, so there was a lot of audience. The tournament was a success and the trophy was won. #LELUSANITE</p>
            
            
                <h2>Burning defeat</h2>
                <img src="images/mies.jpg" class="center">
                <p>Burning defeat...We played the last of the 2019 Games in Cuba on December 28, 2019. It was an invitation tournament that we attended. Participants came from China, Australia, Egypt, Argentina, Brazil and Sweden. We stayed in Havana, the capital of Cuba. The conditions were very hot, the atmosphere was really sweaty, but the Red Bull ice cold drinks kept us in the game. We also had lunch with Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel during the tournament. During the meal we talked about the world of e-Sports and cigars. We played mediocre, but on our own level, and reached the finals, but in the finals we suffered a stinging loss to the Swedish team. The long year was clearly visible in gaming and the trip was more of a holiday than a game trip, but it did good for our brains. We were able to relax together and enjoy the last moments of the year. With new enthusiasm towards next year. LELUSANITE wishes you a happy and peaceful New Year. See you at upcoming events next year as well. #LELUSANITE</p>
              
              
                <h2>Catastrophe</h2>
                <img src="images/kartta.jpg" class="center">
                <p>Catastrophe...We played the last two games of the year in Moscow on 20.12.2019. The tournament was challenging and catastrophic in every way, but hopefully this experience taught us. When traveling from Finland to Russia you must apply for a visa. Already at this point we encountered a problem as Niko was stopped at the customs and kept there for two days. However, our captain Sampsa was spoken to by the authorities, and our mighty captain had reassembled the gang. The night before the tournament, Leevi bought two bars of chocolate and he got bad vomiting, and Luke, who was in the same room, also got the disease. Thus, the starting points for opening the fight were really weak. For the first time in our history, we lost the opening match of the tournament and immediately dropped out. We cried all day. The next morning at breakfast we just got the joy on our face. This kind of thing this time. Hope we improve to the next tournament which is the last of the year. It is played in Cuba. #LELUSANITE</p>
              
              
                <h2>Snow is coming</h2>
                <img src="images/tyttö.jpg" class="center">
                <p>Snow is coming ... The first tournament we participated in December, Tallinn 5.12.2019. There were a few teams in the tournament, which meant we played against a few teams more than once. This was new and also very interesting. The tournament had a nasty episode when, Luke got a coin in the head. One of the spectators was nervous when Luke repeatedly eliminated the spectator's cousin on the opposing team. We lost to the Senegalese team in the semifinals, but the tournament still tasted good. We greatly enjoyed our meals, as well as the tax free section of the ship. #LELUSANITE</p>
