              <p>Yet again another victory for...we were playing 12.1.2020, the first tournament of the year was played in Rauma. There were 8 teams from Finland. The tournament lasted two days and we got a good training session and met more potential partners, so the tournament was also good for marketing. We rarely take part in tournaments in Finland, so there was a lot of audience. The tournament was a success and the trophy was won. #LELUSANITE</p>

                <h2>Burning defeat</h2>
                <img src="images/mies.jpg" width="400px">
                <p>Burning defeat...We played the last of the 2019 Games in Cuba on December 28, 2019. It was an invitation tournament that we attended. Participants came from China, Australia, Egypt, Argentina, Brazil and Sweden. We stayed in Havana, the capital of Cuba. The conditions were very hot, the atmosphere was really sweaty, but the Red Bull ice cold drinks kept us in the game. We also had lunch with Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel during the tournament. During the meal we talked about the world of e-Sports and cigars. We played mediocre, but on our own level, and reached the finals, but in the finals we suffered a stinging loss to the Swedish team. The long year was clearly visible in gaming and the trip was more of a holiday than a game trip, but it did good for our brains. We were able to relax together and enjoy the last moments of the year. With new enthusiasm towards next year. LELUSANITE wishes you a happy and peaceful New Year. See you at upcoming events next year as well.</p>
