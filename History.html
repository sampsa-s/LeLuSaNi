        <p>
            We're the LELUSANITE! We all studied computer science / IT. We have always liked to play ourselves, all very different games. Now, however, we are all playing the same game. We found each other after school started and through common hours we were joined by the Game World and we had all tried Fortnite. One Monday at school, while we were eating, Sampsa announced that we would play Fortnite together today. We laughed at first with Luukas, but then realized that Sampsa was serious about it. Leevi wasn't interested in Fortnite at the time, but still came to play with us. On Tuesday, Leevi suggested that yesterday's games went so well that more should be done. After a brief reflection, we decided to start playing as a team. We played and we played. We played so long the next day that we forgot to go to school. We were so interested in gaming that we thought of trying it out on a professional level.

            Our games improved a lot over the years and after several Finnish championships we thought we would jump to the next level. The next level would be the World Championships in Paris. We were nervous for a long time about getting a license for the event. One Saturday night, the phone rang - "you are accepted to the tournament". We cried, hugged, laughed together, everything seemed unrealistic. The next day we already started to create a plan for the Games.

            Time passed and it was finally time for the Games. We were really excited about our first game. However, we won all the games in the early stages. In the final, the Cuba's team “Destroyers” was up against. With Leevi's stunning individual performance, we won our first world championship.

            The games played in China were the most interesting we've been to. The event took place on land and the internet connections were really weak. A few matches had to be interrupted because of poor connections. We played good games but lost the finals to the Belgian team "Lions". Shanghai as a city was fantastic.<figure><img src="images/battle.jpg" width="400px" height="250px" align="right"> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>
