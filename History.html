            We're the LELUSANITE! We all studied computer science / IT. We have always liked to play ourselves, all very different games. Now, however, we are all playing the same game. We found each other after school started and through common hours we were joined by the Game World and we had all tried Fortnite. One Monday at school, while we were eating, Sampsa announced that we would play Fortnite together today. We laughed at first with Luke, but then realized that Samspsa was serious about it. Levi wasn't interested in Fortnite at the time, but still came to play with us. On Tuesday, Leevi suggested that yesterday's games went so well that more should be done. After a brief reflection, we decided to start playing as a team. We played and we played. We played so long the next day that we forgot to go to school. We were so interested in gaming that we thought of trying it out on a professional level.
