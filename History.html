            We're the LELUSANITE! We all studied computer science / IT. We have always liked to play ourselves, all very different games. Now, however, we are all playing the same game. We found each other after school started and through common hours we were joined by the Game World and we had all tried Fortnite. One Monday at school, while we were eating, Sampsa announced that we would play Fortnite together today. We laughed at first with Luukas, but then realized that Samspsa was serious about it. Leevi wasn't interested in Fortnite at the time, but still came to play with us. On Tuesday, Leevi suggested that yesterday's games went so well that more should be done. After a brief reflection, we decided to start playing as a team. We played and we played. We played so long the next day that we forgot to go to school. We were so interested in gaming that we thought of trying it out on a professional level.

        <p>
            Our games improved a lot over the years and after several Finnish championships we thought we would jump to the next level. The next level would be the World Championships in Paris. We were nervous for a long time about getting a license for the event. One Saturday night, the phone rang - "you are accepted to the tournament". We cried, hugged, laughed together, everything seemed unrealistic. The next day we already started to create a plan for the Games.

            Time passed and it was finally time for the Games. We were really excited about our first game. However, we won all the games in the early stages. In the final, the Cuban team “Destroyers” was up against. With Leevi's stunning individual performance, we won our first world championship.<figure><img src="images/sniper.jpg" width="400px" height="250px"> <figcaption> Leevi's one last shot at final game ,2015 </figcaption> </figure> The main prize in the Paris tournament was € 29M. To this day, we still remember that profit. Since then, only the sky has been the limit. Sponsors, partners have been found.
            Apple has been the main sponsor. Other big supporters have been Red Bull, Makia and Gigantti. We play on Apple computers and use their phones and headsets. Makia dresses us up at match events, and thanks to Red Bull, we get the drinks we need to bring the game to life. Gigantti is our supplier.
